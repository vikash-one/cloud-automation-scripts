# Cloud Automation Scripts

Welcome to the **Cloud Automation Scripts** repository! This project contains a collection of scripts to automate cloud infrastructure management tasks, including working with AWS resources, Terraform configurations, and general-purpose shell scripts.

## Contents

### AWS Scripts
- **`aws_vpc_config.py`**: A Python script that automates the configuration and management of AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources, including subnets, route tables, and more.
- **`aws_s3_upload.py`**: A Python script to automate the upload of files and data to AWS S3.

### Terraform Scripts
- **`terraform_apply.sh`**: A shell script that applies Terraform configurations to provision cloud resources in a consistent and automated way.
- **`terraform_destroy.sh`**: A shell script that destroys resources previously created by Terraform configurations.

### Shell Scripts
- **`backup.sh`**: A shell script designed to automate the backup of critical data from cloud services to local storage or another cloud service.
- **`deploy.sh`**: A shell script used to deploy applications and services to cloud infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Required for AWS-related scripts (`aws_vpc_config.py`, `aws_s3_upload.py`).
- **AWS CLI**: Must be installed and configured for the AWS-related scripts.
- **Terraform**: Required to use the Terraform-related scripts (`terraform_apply.sh`, `terraform_destroy.sh`).
- **Bash**: For the shell scripts to run (`backup.sh`, `deploy.sh`).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-automation-scripts.git
    cd cloud-automation-scripts
    ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies** (if using AWS scripts):

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, and then install required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install boto3
    ```

3. **Setup AWS CLI** (for AWS scripts):

    Ensure you have AWS CLI configured with the necessary IAM credentials:

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

4. **Terraform Setup** (for Terraform scripts):

    Ensure Terraform is installed on your machine:

    ```bash
    terraform --version
    ```

5. **Run the Scripts**:

    - To run AWS VPC configuration:

      ```bash
      python scripts/aws/aws_vpc_config.py
      ```

    - To upload files to S3:

      ```bash
      python scripts/aws/aws_s3_upload.py
      ```

    - To apply Terraform configurations:

      ```bash
      bash scripts/terraform/terraform_apply.sh
      ```

    - To destroy Terraform-managed resources:

      ```bash
      bash scripts/terraform/terraform_destroy.sh
      ```

    - To create a backup:

      ```bash
      bash scripts/shell/backup.sh
      ```

    - To deploy an application:

      ```bash
      bash scripts/shell/deploy.sh
      ```
